# python_vfx
Main feature of this code is to make segmentation of a person and create some fancy background.
In this demo background is created by c++ program life.
Output of life_gpu is bunch of png files saved in directory.
Life gpu is modified cellular automata rules originaly presented by Conway in 1971. 
Life_gpu make all calculations on of CA a GPU as you already figure out from the program name.
In video_segmentation.py i try to simulate some holographic effect.
I assume that scene is performed on a spaceship far from the Earth
